Project Overview:

This project implements a Unix-like shell with advanced features including variable support, built-in commands, and networking capabilities. The shell provides an interactive command-line interface that supports executing external programs while offering a suite of integrated utilities for common operations.

Key Features

The shell supports a comprehensive set of features designed to provide a robust command-line experience. Built-in commands include file operations like directory listing and file concatenation, process management utilities, and text processing tools. The implementation includes a sophisticated variable system that supports expansion and substitution, allowing users to store and manipulate values.

A notable feature is the integrated networking capability, which enables the shell to function as both a server and client. The server component supports multiple concurrent connections using a threaded architecture, with message broadcasting to all connected clients. This networking layer includes proper connection handling and resource management.

Technical Implementation

The shell's architecture is organized into modular components, each handling specific functionality. The variable system maintains a linked list of key-value pairs with support for expansion in commands and other variables. Process execution is managed with proper forking and signal handling, including background process support.

The networking implementation uses POSIX sockets and pthreads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. A mutex-protected data structure manages client connections and message broadcasting. The code includes robust error handling and resource cleanup throughout all components.

Building and Running

To use the shell, clone the repository and compile using the provided Makefile. The build process generates a single executable that launches the interactive shell environment. The implementation has been tested on Linux systems with standard development toolchains.

The networking features require no additional dependencies beyond standard POSIX libraries. When running as a server, the shell listens on a specified port, while the client mode connects to an existing server instance. All networking operations include appropriate error checking and connection state management.
